## Key Features

### AI-Assisted Prompt Editing
- **AI Edit Button:** Located in the System Prompt step of the Create Agent wizard
- **Natural Language Instructions:** Describe how you want to modify the prompt in plain English
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and OpenRouter
- **Preview & Apply:** Review AI suggestions before applying them
- **Examples:**
  - "Make the prompt more formal and professional"
  - "Add instructions for the agent to cite sources"
  - "Make it friendlier and more conversational"
  - "Add specific expertise in Python and machine learning"

### Model Discovery & Browsing
- **Fetch Available Models:** Button in Add Provider dialog fetches models from API
- **Supported Providers:**
  - **OpenAI:** Fetches via `/v1/models` endpoint
  - **OpenRouter:** Fetches via `/api/v1/models` endpoint with model metadata
  - **Anthropic:** Shows curated list (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku, Opus, etc.)
  - **Google:** Shows curated list (Gemini 2.0 Flash, 1.5 Pro/Flash, etc.)
  - **Custom:** Attempts OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Smart Dropdown:** Populates dropdown with fetched models showing context length
- **Fallback Manual Entry:** Can still type model name manually
- **24-Hour Caching:** Reduces API calls for model lists

### Voice Discovery & Preview
- **Automatic Voice Fetching:** Loads voices when voice selection dialog opens
- **OpenAI Voices:** Shows 6 built-in voices (Alloy, Echo, Fable, Onyx, Nova, Shimmer) with descriptions
- **ElevenLabs Integration:**
  - Fetches user's voices via API
  - Shows voice metadata and labels
  - Supports custom voice IDs
- **Voice Preview:** Play button generates and plays sample audio for each voice
- **Multi-Select Support:** Select multiple voices for deterministic agent assignment
- **Real-time Preview:** Uses actual TTS APIs to generate preview audio
- **Loading States:** Shows loading spinner while fetching voices

### Reactive Data Flow
- Uses NDK Svelte's `$subscribe()` for automatic reactivity
- No manual subscription cleanup needed
- Real-time updates when new agents are published

### Forking & Cloning
- **Fork:** Creates new version of existing agent, increments version number, adds "e" tag reference
- **Clone:** Creates independent copy with unique slug, adds "cloned-from" tag reference

### Markdown Support
- Uses `marked` library for rendering agent instructions
- Preview step in creation wizard
- Rendered markdown in detail view

### Search & Filtering
- Client-side search across name, description, and role
- Filter by ownership (owned vs subscribed)
- Responsive empty states

## Technical Implementation

### Following Migration Patterns
All components follow the patterns outlined in MIGRATION_PLAN.md:

1. **Reactive-First Architecture:** Using Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect)
2. **Direct NDK Usage:** No unnecessary wrappers, using ndk.$subscribe() directly
3. **Automatic Cleanup:** Subscriptions clean up automatically when components unmount
4. **Component Isolation:** Each component is self-contained

### Differences from React Version

**Simplified:**
- No complex UI library dependencies (using simple dialog pattern)
- Direct use of NDK Svelte reactivity instead of hooks
- Cleaner state management with runes

**Maintained:**
- All CRUD functionality
- Multi-step wizard
- Fork/clone capabilities
- Search and filtering
- Agent deduplication logic

**Enhanced:**
- Model browsing now fetches from actual APIs (OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- Voice selection now fetches and displays real voices from providers
- Voice preview uses actual TTS APIs to generate sample audio
- Better error handling and loading states throughout

## Dependencies Added
- `marked` - For markdown rendering
- `ai` - Vercel AI SDK core
- `@ai-sdk/openai` - OpenAI provider for AI SDK
- `@ai-sdk/anthropic` - Anthropic provider for AI SDK
- `@ai-sdk/google` - Google provider for AI SDK
- `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` - OpenRouter provider for AI SDK

## Testing

The development server starts successfully without errors.

**Agent CRUD Testing:**
1. Navigate to `/agents` to see the agent list
2. Click "Create Agent" to test the creation wizard
3. In Step 2, test the "AI Edit" button for prompt improvement
4. Click on an agent card to view details
5. Test forking and cloning from the detail page

**Model Discovery Testing:**
1. Navigate to Settings → AI Settings
2. Click "Add New Configuration"
3. Select a provider (OpenAI or OpenRouter)
4. Enter your API key
5. Click "Fetch Available Models" to see the model list
6. Select a model from the dropdown or enter manually
7. Save the configuration

**Voice Discovery & Preview Testing:**
1. Navigate to Settings → AI Settings → Voice Settings
2. Enable Text-to-Speech
3. Select a provider (OpenAI or ElevenLabs)
4. Enter API key (if required)
5. Click "Select Voice" to open the voice selection dialog
6. Wait for voices to load automatically
7. Click the "Preview" button on any voice to hear a sample
8. Select a voice and confirm
9. Test the "Preview" button in the main settings to hear your selected voice

## Next Steps

Optional enhancements (not required for basic CRUD):
- Add agent deletion UI (marks as hidden)
- Add agent lesson viewing/creation
- Add agent instance management
- Add agent pack support
- Add search filtering by tools/capabilities
- Add sorting options (by date, name, version)
- Add pagination for large agent lists

## Notes

- Agent definitions use kind 4199 events
- The NDKAgentDefinition class was already ported and matches the React version
- All components use the same simple dialog pattern as other dialogs in the Svelte app
- No backwards compatibility maintained (clean, modern code only)
