# Agent Definition Pages Migration Summary

## Completed: Agent Definition CRUD Migration to Svelte 5

This document summarizes the migration of the agent definition pages and CRUD functionality from the React app to Svelte 5.

## What Was Migrated

### 1. Event Classes
- ✅ NDKAgentDefinition class (already existed at `src/lib/events/NDKAgentDefinition.ts`)
- ✅ NDKAgentLesson class (already existed)
- ✅ NDKMCPTool class (already existed)

### 2. Routes Structure
Created the following route structure:
- `/agents` - Main agent definitions listing page
- `/agents/[id]` - Individual agent definition detail page

**Files:**
- `src/routes/agents/+page.svelte` - Agents list page
- `src/routes/agents/[id]/+page.svelte` - Agent detail page

### 3. Components

#### Agent Components
**Location:** `src/lib/components/agents/`

- ✅ **AgentDefinitionCard.svelte** - Card component for displaying agent definitions in grid view
  - Shows agent avatar with color coding
  - Displays name, role, description
  - Shows version badge
  - Shows phase count if applicable
  - Shows author info and creation date

#### Dialog Components
**Location:** `src/lib/components/dialogs/`

- ✅ **CreateAgentDialog.svelte** - Multi-step wizard for creating, forking, and cloning agents
  - Step 1: Basic Information (name, description, role, slug)
  - Step 2: System Prompt (instructions) with AI assistance
  - Step 3: Preview (markdown rendered preview)
  - Step 4: Tools & MCP Servers
  - Step 5: Phase Definitions
  - Step 6: Use Criteria & Version
  - Supports forking with version increment
  - Supports cloning with unique slug
  - **NEW: AI Edit button** in Step 2 opens AI-assisted prompt editor

- ✅ **AIAssistedPromptEditor.svelte** - AI-powered prompt improvement tool
  - Select from configured LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter)
  - Enter natural language instructions for prompt modifications
  - Preview current and generated prompts
  - Apply or reject AI suggestions
  - Integrates with aiConfigStore for LLM configurations

### 4. Utilities
- ✅ **agent-colors.ts** - Deterministic color generation for agent avatars

### 5. Pages

#### Agent Definitions List Page (`/agents`)
**Features:**
- Lists all agent definitions with deduplication by slug/name
- Shows only the latest version of each agent
- Search functionality (searches name, description, role)
- Filter options:
  - All Definitions
  - My Definitions (owned by current user)
  - Subscribed (from other users)
- Grid layout with responsive design
- Empty state when no agents found
- Create Agent button (requires authentication)

#### Agent Definition Detail Page (`/agents/[id]`)
**Features:**
- Full agent definition view with tabs
- Tabs:
  - **Details:** Shows description, instructions (markdown rendered), use criteria, tools, MCP servers, metadata
  - **Phases:** Shows phase definitions if present
- Actions dropdown:
  - Fork (creates new version with incremented version number)
  - Clone (creates independent copy with unique slug)
- Copy agent ID to clipboard
- Back navigation to agents list
- Empty state when agent not found

## CRUD Operations

### Create ✅
- Multi-step wizard with validation
- Creates new NDKAgentDefinition event
- Publishes to Nostr relays via NDK

### Read ✅
- Real-time subscription to agent definition events (kind 4199)
- Automatic deduplication showing latest versions
- Fetches related MCP tools when viewing details

### Update ✅
- Fork functionality: Creates new version with "e" tag reference to previous version
- Clone functionality: Creates independent copy with unique slug

### Delete
- Not implemented (Nostr events cannot be deleted, only hidden/replaced with newer versions)

## Key Features

### AI-Assisted Prompt Editing (NEW!)
- **AI Edit Button:** Located in the System Prompt step of the Create Agent wizard
- **Natural Language Instructions:** Describe how you want to modify the prompt in plain English
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and OpenRouter
- **Preview & Apply:** Review AI suggestions before applying them
- **Examples:**
  - "Make the prompt more formal and professional"
  - "Add instructions for the agent to cite sources"
  - "Make it friendlier and more conversational"
  - "Add specific expertise in Python and machine learning"

### Reactive Data Flow
- Uses NDK Svelte's `$subscribe()` for automatic reactivity
- No manual subscription cleanup needed
- Real-time updates when new agents are published

### Forking & Cloning
- **Fork:** Creates new version of existing agent, increments version number, adds "e" tag reference
- **Clone:** Creates independent copy with unique slug, adds "cloned-from" tag reference

### Markdown Support
- Uses `marked` library for rendering agent instructions
- Preview step in creation wizard
- Rendered markdown in detail view

### Search & Filtering
- Client-side search across name, description, and role
- Filter by ownership (owned vs subscribed)
- Responsive empty states

## Technical Implementation

### Following Migration Patterns
All components follow the patterns outlined in MIGRATION_PLAN.md:

1. **Reactive-First Architecture:** Using Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect)
2. **Direct NDK Usage:** No unnecessary wrappers, using ndk.$subscribe() directly
3. **Automatic Cleanup:** Subscriptions clean up automatically when components unmount
4. **Component Isolation:** Each component is self-contained

### Differences from React Version

**Simplified:**
- No complex UI library dependencies (using simple dialog pattern)
- Direct use of NDK Svelte reactivity instead of hooks
- Cleaner state management with runes

**Maintained:**
- All CRUD functionality
- Multi-step wizard
- Fork/clone capabilities
- Search and filtering
- Agent deduplication logic

## Dependencies Added
- `marked` - For markdown rendering
- `ai` - Vercel AI SDK core
- `@ai-sdk/openai` - OpenAI provider for AI SDK
- `@ai-sdk/anthropic` - Anthropic provider for AI SDK
- `@ai-sdk/google` - Google provider for AI SDK
- `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` - OpenRouter provider for AI SDK

## Testing

The development server starts successfully at `http://localhost:5174/` without errors.

To test:
1. Navigate to `/agents` to see the agent list
2. Click "Create Agent" to test the creation wizard
3. Click on an agent card to view details
4. Test forking and cloning from the detail page

## Next Steps

Optional enhancements (not required for basic CRUD):
- Add agent deletion UI (marks as hidden)
- Add agent lesson viewing/creation
- Add agent instance management
- Add agent pack support
- Add search filtering by tools/capabilities
- Add sorting options (by date, name, version)
- Add pagination for large agent lists

## Notes

- Agent definitions use kind 4199 events
- The NDKAgentDefinition class was already ported and matches the React version
- All components use the same simple dialog pattern as other dialogs in the Svelte app
- No backwards compatibility maintained (clean, modern code only)
