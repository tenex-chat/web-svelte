# Streaming Response Test Checklist

## Summary of Changes Made

The issue was that `messageProcessor.ts` had its own local streaming session management that was completely disconnected from our global `streamingMessageStore`. This meant:

1. **Duplicate processing**: Both MessageList and messageProcessor were trying to handle streaming events independently
2. **Lost state**: messageProcessor's local Map was recreated on each call, losing accumulated streaming content
3. **No reactivity**: The local Map in messageProcessor wasn't reactive

## Fix Applied

1. **Filter streaming events BEFORE calling processEventsToMessages**
   - MessageList and CallView now filter out kinds 21111, 24111, 24112 before passing to messageProcessor
   - This prevents messageProcessor from creating its own local streaming sessions

2. **Use ONLY the global streamingMessageStore**
   - The $effect in MessageList/CallView processes streaming events via the global store
   - The flatMessages derived uses streamingMessageStore.getAllSessions() to get current sessions
   - These sessions are converted to synthetic messages and merged with base messages

3. **Reactivity fixes in streamingMessageStore**
   - Changed from Map to Record<string, StreamingSession>
   - Use immutable updates (object spreading) to trigger Svelte reactivity
   - getAllSessions() returns an array for proper reactivity tracking

## Test Steps

1. Send a message that triggers a streaming response
2. Watch the console logs for:
   - `[StreamingStore] Creating new session` - should appear once
   - `[StreamingStore] Updating session` - should appear for each delta
   - `[MessageList] Processing streaming sessions from global store` - should show sessionCount: 1
   - `[MessageList] Rendering streaming message in loop` - CRITICAL: should appear if rendering
   - `[Message Component] RENDERING streaming message!!!` - CRITICAL: confirms Message component received it

3. The UI should show the streaming message content updating incrementally as each delta arrives

## Expected Behavior

- As soon as the first 21111 event arrives, a message should appear in the UI
- The message content should grow with each subsequent 21111 event
- When the final 1111 event arrives, the streaming message should be replaced with the final message

## Current Status

Based on the logs, we're seeing:
- ✅ StreamingStore creating and updating sessions correctly
- ✅ MessageList seeing the sessions (sessionCount: 1)
- ✅ MessageList combining messages (streamingMessages: 1)
- ❌ But the Message component logs aren't firing

Next debugging step: Check if the {#each} loop is actually iterating over the streaming messages.
