# Project Creation Wizard - Documentation Summary

Complete documentation package for replicating the React project creation wizard in Svelte.

## Overview

This documentation provides everything needed to implement a sophisticated multi-step project creation wizard in Svelte, based on the reference React implementation found in the TENEX-web-8bde0h project.

The wizard guides users through:
1. Entering project details (name, description, tags, URLs)
2. Selecting agents (individual or pre-configured packs)
3. Selecting MCP tools
4. Reviewing and creating the project

## Key Patterns to Master

1. **Multi-step form navigation** - Moving between steps with validation
2. **Set-based selection** - Using Set for O(1) agent/tool selection
3. **Agent version management** - Keeping only latest version of each agent
4. **Pack behavior** - Selecting a pack pre-selects all its agents
5. **Auto-installation** - MCP servers automatically added based on agent requirements
6. **Reactive state in Svelte** - Proper reactivity triggers for Set mutations
7. **Form validation** - Name/description required, others optional

## Critical Implementation Details

### Version Management Algorithm
```
1. Group agents by unique identifier (slug/name)
2. For each group:
   - Keep only 1 (latest by created_at DESC, then version DESC)
3. Display deduplicated list
```

### Set Mutation Reactivity
```svelte
// Wrong - won't trigger update
selectedAgents.add(id);

// Correct - triggers reactivity
selectedAgents.add(id);
selectedAgents = selectedAgents;
```

### Pack Selection Behavior
```
User selects pack
  ├─ Set selectedPackId = pack.id
  ├─ Pre-populate selectedAgents with all pack agents
  └─ Display: "Pack selected. All agents from this pack..."

User can deselect individual agents or add more
```

### MCP Server Auto-Installation
```
When creating project:
  1. For each selected agent, get agent.mcpServers array
  2. Collect all MCP server event IDs (deduplicated)
  3. Add to project via project.addMCPTool()
```

## Success Criteria

Your implementation is complete when:

- [x] All 4 wizard steps render correctly
- [x] Navigation between steps works (forward/backward)
- [x] Form validation prevents proceeding without name/description
- [x] Agent selection works (individual and pack selection)
- [x] Tool selection works independently
- [x] Review page shows accurate summary
- [x] Project creation publishes to Nostr
- [x] Navigation to new project works
- [x] MCP servers auto-added for selected agents
- [x] Loading states show during fetches
- [x] Error handling with toast notifications
- [x] All tests in IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md pass

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: State not updating after Set mutation
**Solution**: Add `selectedAgents = selectedAgents;` after modifications

**Issue**: Agents showing duplicates
**Solution**: Implement version management algorithm from REFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

**Issue**: Can't proceed from step 1
**Solution**: Check validation logic - need name AND description

**Issue**: Selected agents lost when moving to next step
**Solution**: Check reactive statements and ensure state persists (not reset)

**Issue**: MCP servers not added with agents
**Solution**: Check that agent.mcpServers is being read and project.addMCPTool() is being called

## Final Notes

This documentation represents a comprehensive reference for implementing a complex multi-step wizard in Svelte. It includes:

- Feature specifications
- Architecture diagrams and flows
- Code pattern conversions
- Component references
- State management details
- Implementation phases
- Testing guidance
- Troubleshooting help

All reference locations point to exact file paths that can be opened and reviewed in real-time.

The implementation should take 6-10 days with proper planning and testing. Start with Phase 1 (core structure), then progress through phases 2-5 (features), and finish with Phase 6 (polish and testing).

Good luck with the implementation!
