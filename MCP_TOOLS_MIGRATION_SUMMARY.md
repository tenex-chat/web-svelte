# MCP Tools CRUD Migration Summary

## Completed: MCP Tools CRUD Migration to Svelte 5

This document summarizes the migration of the MCP tools pages and CRUD functionality from the React app to Svelte 5.

## What Was Migrated

### 1. Event Class
- ✅ NDKMCPTool class (already existed at `src/lib/events/NDKMCPTool.ts`)
  - Properties: name, description, command, parameters, capabilities
  - Kind: 4200

### 2. Routes Structure
Created the following route structure:
- `/tools` - Main MCP tools listing page
- `/tools/[id]` - Individual tool detail page

**Files:**
- `src/routes/tools/+page.svelte` - Tools list page
- `src/routes/tools/[id]/+page.svelte` - Tool detail page

### 3. Components

#### MCP Components
**Location:** `src/lib/components/mcp/`

- ✅ **MCPToolCard.svelte** - Card component for displaying MCP tools in grid view
  - Shows tool icon based on command
  - Displays name, description, command
  - Shows capabilities badges
  - Edit/delete actions for owners
  - Click to navigate to detail page

#### Dialog Components
**Location:** `src/lib/components/dialogs/`

- ✅ **CreateMCPToolDialog.svelte** - Dialog for creating and editing MCP tools
  - Name input (required)
  - Description textarea
  - Command input (required)
  - Capabilities management (add/remove)
  - Edit mode support
  - Form validation
  - Loading states

### 4. Pages

#### MCP Tools List Page (`/tools`)
**Features:**
- Lists all MCP tools
- Search functionality (searches name, description, command, capabilities)
- Filter options:
  - All Tools
  - My Tools (owned by current user)
- Grid layout with responsive design
- Empty state when no tools found
- Create Tool button (requires authentication)
- Real-time updates via NDK subscription

#### MCP Tool Detail Page (`/tools/[id]`)
**Features:**
- Full tool view with metadata
- Displays:
  - Tool name and icon
  - Description
  - Command (in code block)
  - Capabilities (as badges)
  - Tool ID with copy button
  - Creation date and author
- Actions dropdown (for owners):
  - Edit tool
  - Delete tool
- Back navigation to tools list
- Loading state while fetching

## CRUD Operations

### Create ✅
- Simple form dialog with validation
- Creates new NDKMCPTool event
- Publishes to Nostr relays via NDK
- Required fields: name, command
- Optional: description, capabilities

### Read ✅
- Real-time subscription to MCP tool events (kind 4200)
- Automatic updates when new tools are published
- Individual tool fetching by ID
- Search and filter capabilities

### Update ✅
- Edit dialog pre-populated with tool data
- Updates existing NDKMCPTool event
- Publishes updated event to relays
- Only available to tool owners

### Delete ✅
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Creates deletion event (kind 5)
- Publishes deletion to relays
- Removes tool from view
- Only available to tool owners

## Key Features

### Real-time Sync
- Uses NDK Svelte's `$subscribe()` for automatic reactivity
- No manual subscription cleanup needed
- Instant updates when tools are created/modified/deleted

### Ownership Control
- Edit/delete actions only visible to tool owners
- "You" badge on owned tools
- Filter by "My Tools" to see only your creations

### Search & Filtering
- Client-side search across all tool properties
- Filter by ownership (all vs mine)
- Responsive empty states

### Simple CRUD Interface
- No multi-step wizard needed (simpler than agent definitions)
- Inline capabilities management
- Direct edit from card or detail page

## Technical Implementation

### Following Migration Patterns
All components follow the patterns outlined in MIGRATION_PLAN.md:

1. **Reactive-First Architecture:** Using Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect)
2. **Direct NDK Usage:** No unnecessary wrappers, using ndk.$subscribe() directly
3. **Automatic Cleanup:** Subscriptions clean up automatically when components unmount
4. **Component Isolation:** Each component is self-contained

### Differences from React Version

**Simplified:**
- No complex UI library dependencies (using simple dialog pattern)
- Direct use of NDK Svelte reactivity instead of hooks
- Cleaner state management with runes
- Simpler layout (grid view instead of split view)

**Maintained:**
- All CRUD functionality
- Search and filtering
- Ownership controls
- Real-time updates

**Enhanced:**
- Direct navigation to tool detail page from card
- Better empty states
- Cleaner visual design
- Simplified capabilities management

## Testing

The development server starts successfully without errors at `http://localhost:5175/`.

**MCP Tools CRUD Testing:**
1. Navigate to `/tools` to see the tools list
2. Click "New Tool" to create a tool (requires authentication)
3. Fill in name, description, command
4. Add capabilities using the input and "Add" button
5. Click "Create Tool" to publish
6. View your tool in the "My Tools" filter
7. Click on a tool card to view details
8. Test editing by clicking the edit button
9. Test deletion by clicking the delete button (with confirmation)
10. Test search by typing in the search box

## Next Steps

Optional enhancements (not required for basic CRUD):
- Add parameters field support (currently in schema but not in UI)
- Add tool versioning
- Add tool categories or tags
- Add usage statistics
- Add tool testing/validation
- Add import/export functionality

## Notes

- MCP tools use kind 4200 events
- The NDKMCPTool class was already ported and matches the React version
- All components use the same simple dialog pattern as other dialogs in the Svelte app
- No backwards compatibility maintained (clean, modern code only)
- Deletion uses Nostr kind 5 events (standard deletion mechanism)
